Hi, I’m Ryan. I built this site, but technically I don’t run it—the ferrets do. I’m just their human liaison, here to wrangle servers, handle domain names, and keep the kibble stocked. The actual reviewing is done by a cadre of whiskered professionals with far more energy and attitude than I could ever muster.

You might be asking: is Error Ferret a serious developer tool? No. If you’re looking for enterprise dashboards, Jira integrations, or a productivity cult disguised as a code review bot—I hear there are some rabbits that are more serious about this. The ferrets have no patience for such things. They prefer sniffing through your code, squeaking their opinions, and leaving behind commentary that’s helpful but not humorless.

Think of this site less like a rigid CI/CD gate and more like inviting a band of eccentric houseguests to rummage through your project. They’ll point out bugs, odd smells, or questionable habits, but they’ll also keep it light. I just built the stage. The ferrets do the show.
